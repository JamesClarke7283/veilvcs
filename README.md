Emphasizing anonymous collaboration, Veil ensures contributors can work together securely without revealing their identities or the exact timing of their contributions.

With Veil, enjoy the freedom to contribute to shared goals, knowing your privacy is protected.

## Features

### Privacy & Anonymity

- **Order-Only Change Tracking:** Veil prioritizes privacy by not recording the real-world time of changes. It only reveals the sequence in which changes were made, ensuring dates and times remain confidential.
- **Optional & Anonymous Authorship:** Users are encouraged to use usernames instead of real names for author fields, enhancing anonymity. This field is entirely optional, allowing contributors to decide their level of disclosure.

- **Encrypted Commit Messages:** To safeguard the details of each contribution, Veil introduces end-to-end encryption for commit messages. This feature ensures that the content of changes is kept confidential, accessible only to authorized individuals within the project, enhancing the security and privacy of collaborative efforts.
